I am passionate about computing technologies, in imparting the knowledge and to mentor students to equip them with work-ready computing skills. I am constantly acquiring new or updating existing skills through online learning, developer blogs, workshops, and tech-related events.  

My areas of interests include enterprise application solutioning and development, microservices and containers. 

I teach courses related to enterprise solution development and management at the undergraduate level at the School Of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University.
