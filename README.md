I am passionate about computing technologies and dedicated to imparting knowledge and mentoring students to equip them with work-ready computing skills. I continually update and expand my expertise through online learning, developer blogs, workshops, and tech-related events.

My areas of interest include enterprise application solutioning and development, as well as microservices and containers.

I teach courses on enterprise solution development and management at the undergraduate level at the School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University.
